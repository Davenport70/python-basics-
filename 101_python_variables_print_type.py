# Variables
# it is like a box, you give it a name and you put stuff inside of it.
# defining variable book
book = "Rich Dad Poor Dad"

# print function
# outputs content to the terminal (makes it visible)

book
print(book)

# type function
# allows us to check data types.
# use refractor to change all the variable names

data_type_of_book = type(book)
print(data_type_of_book)

# input() - prompt for user input
# and you can add a string to the argument so it prints that before capturing the input
# example
input('this gets print before capturing your input')

## Conventions
# lower case naming for variables with under score
